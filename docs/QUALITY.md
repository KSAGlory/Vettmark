# Quality Review

Vettmark is tested as a static, read-only browser application. The quality checks cover the complete repository-review workflow and the failure states that users can encounter.

## Automated validation

- JavaScript syntax validation
- 37 unit and integration tests for input handling, GitHub API behavior, scoring, incomplete reports, timeouts, cancellation, and rate limits
- Production build validation
- Dependency audit with no known vulnerabilities
- End-to-end workflow tests in Google Chrome on GitHub Actions
- HTML structure validation

## Accessibility review

- WCAG 2.2 A and AA automated checks in light and dark modes
- Keyboard access and logical focus movement
- Report focus after analysis completes
- Visible focus indicators
- Native progress semantics
- Specific loading, validation, offline, rate-limit, and request-failure messages
- Reduced-motion behavior
- Minimum 44-pixel visible control target
- 200 percent zoom-equivalent layout review
- 320-pixel narrow layout review

The automated accessibility scan reports no detected WCAG A or AA violations in the tested primary workflow.

## Security review

- Repository input is restricted to validated GitHub owner and repository segments
- API requests use the fixed `https://api.github.com` origin and the `GET` method
- Browser credentials are omitted and no token is requested
- API-provided text is rendered with `textContent`
- Malicious markup in simulated API data remains inert
- Content Security Policy restricts scripts, assets, forms, and network connections
- No cookies, analytics, tracking, application backend, or persistent browser storage
- No credentials, private keys, tokens, or local filesystem paths are tracked in the repository

## Performance review

The local production profile received scores of 100 for Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices in Lighthouse. The application loads no third-party scripts, makes no API request until the user submits a repository, and uses no production dependencies.

## Scope

The review confirms the implemented public repository workflow and the deployed GitHub Pages application. It does not certify GitHub availability, repository content, application security, or legal compliance.
